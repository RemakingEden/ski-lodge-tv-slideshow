# ski-lodge-tv-slideshow
A Python script to automatically run on the booting of a Pi connected to the TV in a ski lodge. Shows a slideshow and some films on repeat.

This was requested on my seasons a few times and I thought it would not be too hard to throw together. The main things I aim to complete are:
1. An automatic slideshow for the morning so the guests can see avalanche reports, weather and lift status.
2. A film playlist that loops certain snowboard/ski films on silent.
3. An automatic switch between the two at a certain time.
4. Automatic stopping of the films if the tv is turned off.
